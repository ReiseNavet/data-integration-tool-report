# data-integration-tool-report
The Data Integration Tool was developed by students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). 
The [ReiseNavet project](https://reisenavet.no/) provided guidance to the students during the development of the tool. 
This repository contains a report that accompanies the source code of the tool. 

The report describes the process of developing a software solution for SINTEF Digital
during the Customer Driven Project course at NTNU. SINTEF Digital approached NTNU
with a project that was expected to deliver a data integration tool for a Mobility-as-a-Service
(MaaS) platform. With the goal of offering tailor-made mobility solutions for individuals
MaaS represents the future of transportation. MaaS is depending on data integration to
efficiently combine data from different platforms. The report presents the planning, research, process,
and methods practiced by the team.
